## Installation

### CocoaPods

1. Add `pod 'AcknowList'` to your `Podfile`.
2. Run `pod install`.
3. Add the `Pods-#target#-acknowledgements.plist` file generated by CocoaPods to your main target: drag and drop the file from the `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-#target#/` folder to your Xcode project (don‚Äôt copy the file, leave `Copy items if needed` unchecked).

### Swift Package Manager

AcknowList can be installed with the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) (requires Xcode 12 for localized resources).

1. Click on `File` ‚Üí `Add Packages‚Ä¶`.
2. Enter `https://github.com/vtourraine/AcknowList`.
3. Select the version you‚Äôd like to use.
4. Add the `Package.resolved` file generated by Xcode to your main target. Drag and drop the file from the folder to your Xcode project (don‚Äôt copy the file, leave `Copy items if needed` unchecked).
    - For single Xcode projects, the file is in `[appName].xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/`
    - For Xcode workspaces (for instance with CocoaPods), the file is in `[appName].xcworkspace/xcshareddata/swiftpm/`

## Initialization

The `AcknowListViewController` instance is usually pushed to an existing `UINavigationController`.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController()
navigationController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
```

By default, the controller will try to load acknowledgements from a CocoaPods plist file (by guessing its location based on the bundle name), as well as from a `Package.resolved` file.
 
 You can also initialize the view controller with a custom file name or URL.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(fileNamed: "Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements")
```

``` swift
let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements", withExtension: "plist")
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(plistFileURL: url)
```

If you want to include licenses that are not part of a `.plist` or `.resolved` file, you can create new `Acknow` instances, and use them for the acknowledgements array of the controller.

``` swift
let acknow = Acknow(title: "...", text: "...")
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(acknowledgements: [acknow])
```

## Customization

The controller can also display a header and a footer. By default, they are loaded from the generated `plist` file, but you can also directly change the properties values.

``` swift
viewController.headerText = "We love open source software."
viewController.footerText = "Powered by CocoaPods and SPM"
```

The controller title is a localized value for ‚Äúacknowledgements‚Äù. You might want to use this localized value for the button presenting the controller.

``` swift
button.setTitle(AcknowLocalization.localizedTitle(), for: .normal)
```

By default, `AcknowListViewController` uses the ‚Äúgrouped‚Äù table view style. You can choose a different style:

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(plistFileURL: url, style: .plain)
```

If you need to further customize the appearance or behavior of this library, feel free to subclass its classes.

## SwiftUI

AcknowList now offers a SwiftUI interface, which supports all the major platforms.

Instantiate a `AcknowListSwiftUIView` with a path to the `plist` file, or with an array of `Acknow` instances, and present this view from a `NavigationView`.

## Platforms

| Platform | UIKit | SwiftUI |
|:--|:--|:--|
| üì± | iOS 9.0+ | iOS 13.0+ |
| üì∫ | tvOS 9.0+ | tvOS 13.0+ |
| ‚åöÔ∏è | *not supported* | watchOS 7.0+ |
| üíª | *not supported* | macOS 10.15+ |

‚ö†Ô∏è If you install AcknowList with CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager, it will require iOS 13 and tvOS 13. To support earlier versions, please import this library manually, and ignore the SwiftUI classes. Alternatively, use [VTAcknowledgementsViewController](https://github.com/vtourraine/VTAcknowledgementsViewController) instead.

## Requirements

AcknowList is written in Swift 5, and requires Xcode 12 and above.
